### Motion Synthesis
Motion Synthesis can be defined as generating new versions of a dataset which follow the original distribution. Autoregression (AR)
processes have been used in tracking and for synthesizing video textures (a temporal texture). It's a parametric modeling technique, which models every point in
sequence as a linear combination of d previous points.
