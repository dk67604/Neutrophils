### Motion Synthesis
Motion Synthesis can be defined as generating new versions of a dataset which follow the original distribution. Autoregression (AR)
processes have been used in tracking and for synthesizing video textures (a temporal texture). It's a parametric modeling technique, which models every point in
sequence as a linear combination of d previous points.

This folder contains the code to train neutrophil based AR models for synthesizing their trajectories.
1. [plots_and_ar.ipynb](https://github.com/quinngroup/Neutrophils/blob/master/ar/plots_and_ar.ipynb): Contains all the code used for creating AR models based on neutrophil trajectories.
2. [ar.py](https://github.com/quinngroup/Neutrophils/blob/master/ar/ar.py): Contains all the functions to train and testt AR models.
